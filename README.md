# FS ballot.Table ballot.Ballot Checker

This project is for the [Fashion Show](http://standrewsfashion.co.uk) table ballots. Data is uploaded to a cloud database service 
and pulled into a JSON file. This is then parsed and checked for validity.

Valid tables have:
- no duplicate names
- 10 members
- no names that appear on other tables

Really simple project, but was just for practice.
